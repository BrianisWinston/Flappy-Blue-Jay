## The Coin Collector

### Background / Overview

The Coin Collector is an old school-type platform game, completely done in vanilla JavaScript, the player's objective is to collect all the coins without getting burnt by the lava. The physics of the character jumping will help prevent the character from getting into harms way, similar to that of other popular platform games such as Super Mario and Donkey Kong.


### Functionality & MVP  

The Coin Collector should include the following functionality:

- [ ] Movement with the left and right arrow keys.
- [ ] Physics to create a jumping motion.
- [ ] Lava that will hurt and make the character start over.
- [ ] Multiple levels of increasingly harder ways to collect coins.
- [ ] Instructions on the bottom of the page to explain the controls of the game.

### Wireframes

This will be a single screen game and a simple footer.
The footer will contain directions on how to play. The footer will also have nav bar tabs that explain the concept of the game, as well as links to my LinkedIn and GitHub accounts.
